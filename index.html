                I just read a manifesto called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rntz.net/post/against-software-development.html">Against software development</a> by Michael Arntzenius, 
                which is apt considering it's the last week of the semester. The third section of the manifesto, which is all about refusing to work for extractive systems (if you have a choice), 
                really resonated with me. Considering that I'm finished with two out of the three semesters of this program, I've been thinking a lot about what type of work I'd like to engage with afterwards. I think 
                I have a clear idea of what I don't want, which is everything the manifesto encouraged to refuse. I've worked for a large corporation before, and I wouldn't want to do that again. But I do want to 
                acknowledge that we live within the strictures of capitalism, and it's not easy to operate outside of them. Maybe that's why the manifesto also stressed to refuse *if you have a choice.* Sometimes having that 
                choice is a privelege. However, I am excited because this past semester introduced me to the possibilities of creative coding and the radical spaces and communities that inhabit this world. I'd like to explore 
                those spaces more.
            </p>

            <p>
                The other day, I had a brief conversation with John about this, and he posed the question: "do you want to be a developer or an artist?" I think there's a lot to unpack in this question, and I think both identities 
                can exist simultaneously. I still have so much to learn, but this question will definitely inform the way I approach my work.

                I think I'm finally at a place in my project where I have the concept and tech down. It took a lot of trial and error, but I'm content with how it's shaping up. My
                project is called Other Forms, which explores the generative potential of mold, rot, and decay through typographic form. The <a target="_blank" href="https://niktari.github.io/other-forms/">
                live prototype</a> is close to final, but I'm going to see if there are other ways I could push this further. This is a slight departure from my original idea, in which I was going to incorporate time or a weather
                API to control the rate of growth, but I decided to create a functional tool instead. I did fulfill one of my original intentions though, which was to learn more about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulbourke.net/fractals/lsys/">L-systems</a> and 
                algorithmic botany!

                It's Taurus (my astrological sign) season, and I just finished reading an <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/">essay on spatial interfaces</a> by John Palmer. 
                I'm not a big birthday person, but both things — my birthday and the essay — are reminders of how long we've been exclusively relying on virtual environments for connection and care since the onset of COVID. 
                It's funny that the essay by Palmer was written in 2019, before the overwhelming need to have virtual spaces mimic physical ones. I'm surprised Zoom still hasn't updated its interface to be more 
                skeuomorphic. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This essay also made me reflect on my own design practice. I don't think I really consider spatial affordances in my designs, but I'd like to explore that potential. I've been wanting to experiment with different 
                libraries and programs such as Three.js and Unity. I recently experimented with <a href="https://openscad.org/" target="_blank">OpenSCAD</a>, which is a 3D Javascript library mainly used for 3D printing, and it was surprisingly a very pleasant experience.
                Designing within a 3D plane is pretty challenging, but the output can be rewarding. Although spatial design doesn't exclusively mean 3D, I do want to incorporate more of these considerations into my work.

                I really enjoyed reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4f7a10h41p2nn7m/01_ford_democratize-the-internet-now.pdf?dl=0">Democratize the Internet Now!</a> by 
                Paul Ford. I especially enjoyed the anecdotes and analogies to demonstrate his point of how the web became more and more centralized since its inception. I think about the potential 
                of decentralizing and democratizing the web, especially since there's a lot of power and agency in publishing your own site. However, I do feel that language and discourse surrounding 
                the topic of a democratized internet can be over-glorified or flowery. I appreciate that Ford pragmatically addresses this issue when mentioning that there's also money in peer-to-peer 
                technologies, and therefore, those spaces can be as easily exploited. I also found it interesting that it's actually bankers and not hackers that are interested in decentralized technology.

            <p>
                In line with the data concerns that I've reflected on in past journal entries, I thought I'd save this quote from the essay:
            </p>

            <p>
                "If you don’t take care of yourself online, someone else will. That someone is likely not a peer but a megacorporation that is tracking and selling your preferences in a silent auction, 
                a government surveilling your movements and religious affiliations, or a hacker collective that feels entitled to publish your sexual indelicacies. That someone probably already is."
            </p>

                Reading <a target="_blank" href="https://reallifemag.com/data-sweat/">Data Sweat</a> by Amanda K. Greene was pretty frightening. Green references Melissa Gregg, an
                author who coined the term "data sweat," which encapsulates the way in which our seemingly minor and passive online interactions, such as scrolling, mouse movements,
                and tapping, "leak messily out of our pores as opposed to emerging directly from our machines as a kind of industrial waste product" to be used as data. I had written about 
                data and surveillance in previous entries, but I had no idea that actions as minor as hovering could be exploited as some kind of data point. This point from the essay in 
                particular is unsettling:
            </p>

            <p>
                "The fact that our own data sweat frequently leaks out unnoticed makes it a particularly powerful resource for generating these subtle “nudges” that strive to operate below 
                conscious awareness."
            </p>

            <p>
                It's especially unsettling because although there are tools such as VPNs and <a target="_blank" href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> to mitigate surveillance, I wonder 
                if there are tools to prevent my own data sweat from leaking.

                I thought I'd reflect a bit on how my project is going, and this semester at large. The process of this project has been a bit tumultuous for me, and that's 
                probably because this is the most amount of time I've ever been given to work on something in school. The brief for this project is also pretty open-ended and
                iconic: "use the generative nature of the web in anyway you interpret." I appreciate both of these factors, despite running into a multitude of challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
                Not to get too meta, but in addition to the output of this project being generative, the development of it has also been a generative process. And I guess I mean generative
                in the sense of my initial idea keeps changing and shifting for better or worse. The biggest thing that affects the development of my project is tech/skill level restrictions. As much
                as I'd love to use this time to learn 5 different Javascript libraries, there are moments where I find myself scaling back on my initial idea because it was too ambitious. However, I've also experienced 
                some epiphanies where the tech miraculously works and I'm able to push the scaled back version of my idea even further. I guess these are the binary emotions experienced when coding and learning new tech. 
                One moment I feel like an incompetent fool, and the next I feel like an unstoppable god.

                American Artist, is a necessary critique of how white supremacy and anti-Blackness are embedded in our graphical user interfaces — GUIs or gooeys. Although it's not surprising
                that our tech is inherently racist (eyeing all of the cis white men in Silicon Valley), I still find this reality disconcerting. American Artist mentions how gooeys historically
                were a black screen, but in an effort to posit whiteness as neutral, tech behemoths turned screens to white in the spirit of capitalism and corporate productivity. This quote from the essay in
                particular really stuck out to me, especially considering last week's journal entry on handmade websites:
            </p>

            <p>
                "Black gooey might then be a platform of slowness (“dragged time”, “colored time”), refusal, thought, complexity, critique, softness, loudness, transparency, uselessness, and brokenness. 
                A planar body that longs for the solitude and vastness of the command-line, yet nuanced and sharp, to usurp and destroy a contemporary hegemonic interface."
            </p>

            <p>
                This essay also prompts me to dig into and investigate the history behind the tech we use, along with its racial implications. For instance, I recently learned that the p5.js library initially intended
                to be a Bauhaus drawing library given its primitive shape functions. I'm glad that this isn't entirely the case now given the vibrant community that has formed from this library.

                Silvio Lorusso investigates the conditions required for a computer user to gain agency in his essay <a target="_blank" href="https://theusercondition.computer/">The 
                User Condition: Computer Agency and Behavior</a>. Lorusso perfectly articulates a lot of the jumbled thoughts I've been having towards my tumultuous relationship with
                social media, as evidenced by my previous journal entries. It's been about 9 months since I've been on my #DivestFromInstagram wave, and this particular quote from the
                essay stuck out to me:
            </p>

            <p>"...within a certain system, the non-user is the one who possesses maximum agency, more than the standard user, the power user, and maybe even more than the hacker."</p>

            <p>
               This insight isn't entirely surprising, but I started to think more about the act of divesting as an act of power, and perhaps even an act of privlege.
            </p>

            <p>I also started to think about resisting automation not only in the context of social media, but also as a coder. Lorusso briefly mentions the term "handmade web," 
                which was coined by artist and writer J.R. Carpenter to "suggest the slowness and smallness as a forms of resistance." Although Lorusso contends that this slowness, or "friction,"
                can be over glorified, it's interesting to think of code as a handcrafting medium in an effort to resist tendencies to automate. There's an artist (who I'm blanking on) 
                that proposes for loops as something with nebulous potential because of its automated nature. This take might illustrate the over glorification of friction that 
                Lorusso alluded to, but reframing certain Javascript functions and statements in this way gave me some pause.

                I just learned about a net artist duo called <a target="_blank" href="https://jodi.org/">Jodi</a> after reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/74/59810/jodi-s-infrastructure/">Alexander R. Galloway's piece</a> on 
                their "infrastructure." Galloway suggests that there are two basic activities that emerge when it comes to digitality: a person may 1) work "on" the digital or 2) work "within" it.
                In the former mode, which is considered to be modern, infrastructure is everything, which is the throughline of almost all of Jodi's pieces. I especially like this bit where
                Galloway elaborates on how the material of Jodi's work is simply the material itself:
                
            <p>"...the texture of code and computation takes over, and computing itself—its strange logic, its grammar and structure, and often its shape and color—produces the aesthetic."</p>

            <p>It's an interesting framework that I haven't thought of before — code as texture. I guess you could say this concept is similar to the aesthetics of web brutalism, but I've never
                considered the web's infrastructure, what's under the hood, as something that could have poetic potential.

                Frank Chimero’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rf6wssd8olpuwsu/12_chimero_the-good-room.pdf?dl=0">The Good Room</a> is a call-out post I didn’t know I needed. In this presentation of sorts, he poses 
                the question: if technology is a place where we live, shouldn’t we choose to be in lively and nourishing digital 
                environments? I resonate with his rationale in this deck wholeheartedly. With the web becoming more 
                commercialized than ever, what types of digital spaces can we seek refuge in? What’s considered a healthy 
                “digital diet?” What constitutes a <a target="_blank" href="https://i.redd.it/d1vbrhrhoop11.jpg">“good screen” versus a "bad screen"</a>?
            </p>

            <p>
                The other week I wrote about divesting from Instagram, which is funny because I thought doing so was such a 
                valiant move on my part, but after reading about Frank’s personal technological regulations, I’m reminded that 
                I still frequent Twitter and Tik Tok. There are a multitude of reasons why I have disdain for Instagram, but I 
                should probably do more self-reflection on why I still hang onto the other two apps, which are equally as evil. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Frank’s bit about the commercialization of the web also made me think about this past week’s lecture where we 
                discussed the four quadrants that digital spaces can be categorized by: 1) agency/networked, 2) agency/siloed, 
                3) uniform/siloed, and 4) uniform/networked. It also made me realize that there’s a lot of power in publishing your 
                own site in a space that’s cluttered with extractive platforms. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Frank also mentioned that in order for digital environments to be lively and nourishing, they need to be a “space 
                for the soul.” What that looks like requires specific imagination, which is difficult since our imaginations, 
                especially surrounding technology, tend to have a negative flair. This reminded me of what one of my favorite 
                authors, <a target=“_blank” href=“http://adriennemareebrown.net/tag/radical-imagination/“>adrienne maree brown</a> 
                described as an “imagination battle.” I’ve never specifically thought about what an ideal virtual environment should and 
                could be. And to be honest, as I’m posing that question to myself right now, I struggle to imagine those specifics.

            <p>
                I read this article called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/01/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-
                you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram/">The internet didn’t kill counterculture—you just won’t find it on Instagram</a>, 
                and it really resonated. The piece explores the idea of “counterculture” in an era that’s organized by Big Tech. 
                Last fall, I decided to “divest” from Instagram for several reasons, one of which was because I no longer wanted to 
                be tied to my online identity, an identity that informs and contributes to a toxic algorithm. I can’t help but imagine 
                the loads of intrusive information that these tech behemoths have access to, and it freaks me out. There’s a part in the 
                article that talks about the power dynamics between Big Tech companies and its users. Actual power, according to the article, 
                keeps a low profile. It doesn’t need a social media presence, it owns social media. This idea reminded me of a quote from another 
                reading called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm">The Tyranny of Structureless</a> by Jo Freeman, 
                which discusses how horizontal or flat structures can be problematic in feminist organizing spaces. In the essay, Jo contends:
            </p>

            <p>
                “The most insidious elites are usually run by people not known to the larger public at all. Intelligent elitists 
                are usually smart enough not to allow themselves to become well known; when they become known, they are watched, 
                and the mask over their power is no longer firmly lodged.”
            </p>

            <p>
                I think this logic can be applied to Big Tech. These corporations aren’t the overtly evil, top-down, white-collar 
                structures you’d imagine them to be. They come in the form of kombucha-on-tap, flexible-PTO, open-office-plan 
                nonsense. And I think that can arguably be more insidious.
            </p>

            <p> 
                It’s like how people were reasonably overjoyed when Trump was voted out of office, but now we’re back to the 
                same establishment politics that’s been the culprit of a lot of the harm caused prior. “Evil” isn’t as 
                distinguishable anymore, instead, it’s disguised through empty calls for unity and police reform.

                <p>I just finished reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb">this New Yorker article</a> about the 
                    history of Web archiving. Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive and inventor of the Wayback Machine, views the Web as a giant 
                    library and doesn't think it should belong to a sole corporation. He believes, "We are building a library that is us."</p>

                <p>
                    This quote stuck out to me for a number of reasons. Tangential to the topic of the article, I've been thinking a lot about data 
                    privacy, and how through our online activity, we’re contributing to an archive of data collected by data brokers, advertisers, 
                    and internet service providers to be exploited by companies, institutions, and the state. But Wayback Machine functions as the opposite —
                    anyone on the internet can contribute to its archive, which kind of (or maybe this is a stretch) restores autonomy back to users. I don't 
                    know, maybe it's important to distinguish the power dynamic or imbalance of who is doing the archiving and who is being archived. That is my
                    half-baked, unseasoned thought for today. Maybe I'll elaborate more on this in a future entry.

                I've been thinking about this past week's lecture on the origin of the internet. I was born in 1995 and am the product of unsupervised internet activity, 
                for better or worse. I was on Myspace at a very young age, and like many people, learned how to code through there. Although a lot has changed between when 
                the browser was invented and when Myspace was at its peak, the idea of regular people naively creating websites to reflect who they are for no commercial 
                purpose still felt like the spirit of the internet during that era. That was a good time, even though I didn't understand much of what was going on since 
                I was so young.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've also been thinking about what the internet looks like, and how it's very much a physical thing as much as it's digital, so much so that the servers, 
                cables, and wires rooted in our earth and in our walls contribute to a significant portion of global carbon emissions. In trying to visualize the internet, 
                I've been looking at different internets beyond the World Wide Web. I recently learned about the 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-secrets-of-the-wood-wide-web">Wood Wide Web</a>, in which plants communicate 
                with each other through mycorrhizal fungi. Apparently, fungi is considered the earth's "natural internet." I found that to be pretty neat.</p>

                Hello, world? My name is Niktari, but I usually just go by Nikki. At this moment, I'm based in Brooklyn, but for the majority of 
                my life, I grew up in San Diego. I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia and had a short stint in Lawrence, Kansas prior to moving to 
                California. I'm in the AAS Communication Design program at Parsons and am in the midst of a "career change." I used to work in 
                entertainment marketing, but I quit my job at [redacted] because I started hating television. I've taken a couple of coding classes 
                outside and within Parsons, but I still have so much to learn. That being said, I'm hoping to not only develop my technical skills in 
                this class, but also deepen my understanding of code through a more critical and generative lens.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Although I'm still getting a grasp of what "generative" entails, <a target="_blank" href="http://paulbourke.net/fractals/googleearth/">this 
                website</a> that documents fractal patterns found around the world via Google Earth felt generative to me. It's interesting to see 
                generative patterns also appearing in nature.
