                Frank Chimero’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rf6wssd8olpuwsu/12_chimero_the-good-room.pdf?dl=0">The Good Room</a> is a call-out post I didn’t know I needed. In this presentation of sorts, he poses 
                the question: if technology is a place where we live, shouldn’t we choose to be in lively and nourishing digital 
                environments? I resonate with his rationale in this deck wholeheartedly. With the web becoming more 
                commercialized than ever, what types of digital spaces can we seek refuge in? What’s considered a healthy 
                “digital diet?” What constitutes a <a target="_blank" href="https://i.redd.it/d1vbrhrhoop11.jpg">“good screen” versus a "bad screen"</a>?
            </p>

            <p>
                The other week I wrote about divesting from Instagram, which is funny because I thought doing so was such a 
                valiant move on my part, but after reading about Frank’s personal technological regulations, I’m reminded that 
                I still frequent Twitter and Tik Tok. There are a multitude of reasons why I have disdain for Instagram, but I 
                should probably do more self-reflection on why I still hang onto the other two apps, which are equally as evil. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Frank’s bit about the commercialization of the web also made me think about this past week’s lecture where we 
                discussed the four quadrants that digital spaces can be categorized by: 1) agency/networked, agency/siloed, 
                uniform/siloed, and uniform/networked. It also made me realize that there’s a lot of power in publishing your 
                own site in a space that’s cluttered with extractive platforms. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Frank also mentioned that in order for digital environments to be lively and nourishing, they need to be a “space 
                for the soul.” What that looks like requires specific imagination, which is difficult since our imaginations, 
                especially surrounding technology, tend to have a negative flair. This reminded me of what one of my favorite 
                authors, <a target=“_blank” href=“http://adriennemareebrown.net/tag/radical-imagination/“>adrienne maree brown</a> 
                described as an “imagination battle.” I’ve never specifically thought about what an ideal virtual environment should and 
                could be. And to be honest, as I’m posing that question to myself right now, I struggle to imagine those specifics.

            <p>
                I read this article called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/01/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-
                you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram/">The internet didn’t kill counterculture—you just won’t find it on Instagram</a>, 
                and it really resonated. The piece explores the idea of “counterculture” in an era that’s organized by Big Tech. 
                Last fall, I decided to “divest” from Instagram for several reasons, one of which was because I no longer wanted to 
                be tied to my online identity, an identity that informs and contributes to a toxic algorithm. I can’t help but imagine 
                the loads of intrusive information that these tech behemoths have access to, and it freaks me out. There’s a part in the 
                article that talks about the power dynamics between Big Tech companies and its users. Actual power, according to the article, 
                keeps a low profile. It doesn’t need a social media presence, it owns social media. This idea reminded me of a quote from another 
                reading called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm">The Tyranny of Structureless</a> by Jo Freeman, 
                which discusses how horizontal or flat structures can be problematic in feminist organizing spaces. In the essay, Jo contends:
            </p>

            <p>
                “The most insidious elites are usually run by people not known to the larger public at all. Intelligent elitists 
                are usually smart enough not to allow themselves to become well known; when they become known, they are watched, 
                and the mask over their power is no longer firmly lodged.”
            </p>

            <p>
                I think this logic can be applied to Big Tech. These corporations aren’t the overtly evil, top-down, white-collar 
                structures you’d imagine them to be. They come in the form of kombucha-on-tap, flexible-PTO, open-office-plan 
                nonsense. And I think that can arguably be more insidious.
            </p>

            <p> 
                It’s like how people were reasonably overjoyed when Trump was voted out of office, but now we’re back to the 
                same establishment politics that’s been the culprit of a lot of the harm caused prior. “Evil” isn’t as 
                distinguishable anymore, instead, it’s disguised through empty calls for unity and police reform.

                <p>I just finished reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb">this New Yorker article</a> about the 
                    history of Web archiving. Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive and inventor of the Wayback Machine, views the Web as a giant 
                    library and doesn't think it should belong to a sole corporation. He believes, "We are building a library that is us."</p>

                <p>
                    This quote stuck out to me for a number of reasons. Tangential to the topic of the article, I've been thinking a lot about data 
                    privacy, and how through our online activity, we’re contributing to an archive of data collected by data brokers, advertisers, 
                    and internet service providers to be exploited by companies, institutions, and the state. But Wayback Machine functions as the opposite —
                    anyone on the internet can contribute to its archive, which kind of (or maybe this is a stretch) restores autonomy back to users. I don't 
                    know, maybe it's important to distinguish the power dynamic or imbalance of who is doing the archiving and who is being archived. That is my
                    half-baked, unseasoned thought for today. Maybe I'll elaborate more on this in a future entry.

                I've been thinking about this past week's lecture on the origin of the internet. I was born in 1995 and am the product of unsupervised internet activity, 
                for better or worse. I was on Myspace at a very young age, and like many people, learned how to code through there. Although a lot has changed between when 
                the browser was invented and when Myspace was at its peak, the idea of regular people naively creating websites to reflect who they are for no commercial 
                purpose still felt like the spirit of the internet during that era. That was a good time, even though I didn't understand much of what was going on since 
                I was so young.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've also been thinking about what the internet looks like, and how it's very much a physical thing as much as it's digital, so much so that the servers, 
                cables, and wires rooted in our earth and in our walls contribute to a significant portion of global carbon emissions. In trying to visualize the internet, 
                I've been looking at different internets beyond the World Wide Web. I recently learned about the 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-secrets-of-the-wood-wide-web">Wood Wide Web</a>, in which plants communicate 
                with each other through mycorrhizal fungi. Apparently, fungi is considered the earth's "natural internet." I found that to be pretty neat.</p>

                Hello, world? My name is Niktari, but I usually just go by Nikki. At this moment, I'm based in Brooklyn, but for the majority of 
                my life, I grew up in San Diego. I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia and had a short stint in Lawrence, Kansas prior to moving to 
                California. I'm in the AAS Communication Design program at Parsons and am in the midst of a "career change." I used to work in 
                entertainment marketing, but I quit my job at [redacted] because I started hating television. I've taken a couple of coding classes 
                outside and within Parsons, but I still have so much to learn. That being said, I'm hoping to not only develop my technical skills in 
                this class, but also deepen my understanding of code through a more critical and generative lens.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Although I'm still getting a grasp of what "generative" entails, <a target="_blank" href="http://paulbourke.net/fractals/googleearth/">this 
                website</a> that documents fractal patterns found around the world via Google Earth felt generative to me. It's interesting to see 
                generative patterns also appearing in nature.
